    *  2.5 years
<p>&nbsp;</p>


##  5.4  Equivalent Payments and Payment Streams {-}

*  A payment stream consists of \$1950 due today and \$3500 due in 18 months.  These payments will be replaced by an economically equivalent stream comprised of an undetermined payment due in 10 months and a payment of \$3000 due in 24 months. Calculate the unknown replacement payment if money is worth 8% compounded monthly.
    *  \$2887.90
<p>&nbsp;</p>


*  Payments of \$1850 due two years ago and \$1550 due six months ago have not been made.

What is the amount of each of these payments?
    *  $1838.15
<p>&nbsp;</p>


*  The scheduled payment stream consists of \$6000 due today and \$12,000 due in five years.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


*  Payments of \$10,000 due 15 months ago and \$7000 due in six months are to be replaced by a
payment of \$4000 today, a second payment in nine months, and a third payment, three times
as large as the second, in 1.5 years. What should the last two payments be if money is worth
6.4% compounded quarterly?
    *  First payment = \$3772.70, second payment = \$11,318.10.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Eighteen months ago, John borrowed another \$1500 for 2.5 years at 7% compounded semiannually.  John is now proposing to settle both debts with two equal payments to be made one and three years from now. What should the payments be if money now earns 6% compounded quarterly?

[["index.html", "Telling Stories with Data Preface Why read this book", " Telling Stories with Data Joe Hobart Preface I began thinking about data visualization when I became a department chair. I had access to a lot of data and had a boss who, for the most part, would not consider herself brilliant at mathematics or statistics. (I still have a number of bosses like that). I needed a way to help her understand what was going on in my department. Sometimes the issues were as small as projected enrollments and why my projections were correct. Other times the issues were far more complex like trying to explain the course path that a potential student might take. Of course, the latter situation does not even involve numbers (other than perhaps course numbers). However, in both situations, I found that creating a graphic would help her understand the issue with very little need for advanced mathematics or statistics. As my career moved along, I began consulting for a health authority. I had the opportunity to see others use graphics and tables and very often, those graphics and tables were complex and confusing. What people tended to forget when they made a graphic or a table was that they were the experts at working with that particular data set and they expected us plebs to understand the data exactly as they did. To me, there are two problems with that. The first is that we don’t understand the data at the same level as the author because we don’t work with it on a daily basis. Much of the work I did was for Capital Planning. While some of the people involved in capital planning decisions were actual people working in a hospital, many were people who had never stepped foot in the hospital (myself included in several cases). Those people can’t be expected to be intimately familiar with the inner workings of the hospital while doctors and nurses can’t be reasonably expected to understand processes involved in funding capital projects like the purchases of new equipment and the construction of new buildings. Both groups of people bring a different perspective to the discussion and as the person working with the data, I bring yet another perspective. A successful visual in this instance needs to be relatable to everyone working on the project. The second problem is obvious. If your audience knows as much about the data as you do, why are you presenting the data to them? Over the years, I have collected a number of best practices and stories about data visualization and I strive to teach you them in this book. I hope you enjoy and can take some ideas from it. Why read this book We aspire to teach you techniques to tell stories with data in this textbook. Of course, all the techniques in the world will not take the place of common sense or an intimate knowledge of the subject matter and data; however, if you know how to tell the story of your data properly, you will be better able to communicate the meaning of the data to your audience. Throughout this text, we will make reference to the following visual provided to us by David McCandless (McCandless (2012)). McCandless argues that there are keys to creating a good visualization (we will consider what is meant by the term “good” later on). The visual shows us that simply having data isn’t enough - we must be able to be able to create an artistic graphic from the data and pair it with a story with a particular goal in mind. Only then will we have a successful data visualization.

Have you noticed how much data has taken over our everyday lives? If you are a fan of sports, try watching a football, basketball or hockey game while covering the little box that tells you the score and time remaining in the period. It’s maddening. Even your favorite baseball game would not be nearly as good without Pitchtrax, and the box with the inning, score, and count. Image Credits - Sean Keeley (Keeley (2018)) Recently, I’ve found myself watching pre-season baseball. Major League Baseball has just introduced a new pitch-clock to try to speed up the game. As a way to figure out how much time is remaining before the pitcher needs to throw a pitch, I find myself counting down from 15. I’m sure by the time the regular season rolls around next month, FOX, ESPN and Sportsnet (some of the main TV broadcasters) will have found a way to relay that information to me. But the point is that there is a data-related aspect of the game that, if we added it to the data I already have, will enrich my viewing experience. More importantly, I will spend less time counting down the pitch timer and more time enjoying the game and listening to the announcer. Think about that last sentence for a second. I will spend less time counting down the timer and more time listening to the announcer. Now, apply that idea to you presenting an idea in a presentation. If people are spending time and effort on trying to understand your visual, they are spending less time listening to you. Your goal should always be to have people to listen to you as you present data. Major retailers like Walmart, Amazon and others use data they collect from millions of people who visit their websites and stores to recommend you products. Indeed, there is a famous story about a father who phoned the complaints department at Walmart because Walmart sent his 16 year old daughter targeted marketing material meant for someone who was about to have a baby. The material, which consisted of adds for strollers, cribs, cute baby shoes and other baby accessories, also had coupons for diapers and baby formula. The father, furious that Walmart would send advertisements that might encourage his teenage daughter to have sex and get pregnant, yelled at the operator on the other end of the phone and demanded an apology. Image Credits - Arkadiusz Krysik, 2021 As it turns out, the daughter had made some purchases that Walmart’s data team had flagged as strong indicators that the purchaser was pregnant. The store then automatically sent out the marketing material without considering the age of the girl. But, that’s not the entire story. It turns out that the girl was pregnant. And, that’s how Walmart knew a teenage girl was pregnant before her dad did. But, data goes far beyond these simple examples. When you go online, you see adds. These adds target you because of your online preferences, the sites you’ve visited and even parts of the website that you have hovered over. These adds don’t just happen to be for products and services you are interested in. Massive amounts of data were collected and people with similar internet history to you and they will see similar adds to you. Those whose internet history is different will likely see different adds. The data drives the marketing. We all have smartphones. These phones track our steps, take care of email and text messages, track where we are, give us directions and help us navigate social media. This data is all stored and can all be used by the service provider to give you better service. Think about it - when was the last time you had to use a paper map to get somewhere? Do gas stations still sell paper maps? Our smartphone providers have vast amounts of data on you and where you’ve been. By using the various apps on your phone, you have essentially given your phone provider an endless supply of data about you and your habits. Image Credits - Trevor Wheelwright, 2022 The point is that data is all around us and those who use data are in a better position than those who don’t. Daryl Morey is an NBA executive. He once said “Everyone in our business knows they need to visualize data but it’s easy to do it poorly. We invest in it. We’re excited if we can use it right while they use it wrong.” (Berinato (2016)). We hope that after reading this book, you will use it right. 1.1 Growth in Data We are currently living through the greatest expansion in data that the world has ever seen and as a result, it is becoming increasingly important that we understand the data and know how to correctly use it. Part of correctly using data is communication. Over 90% of the world’s data has been produced in the past 2 years (Marr (n.d.)). The graphic below is from 2015 data and depicts the daily amount of data created. All numbers are in billions. Image Credits - Kevin Hartman (Hartman (2022)) The graphic gives an illustration of the amount of data created each day around the world. The area of each box represents the relative area of the particular type of data being created each day. For example, there are 4.5 billion facebook likes every day (you don’t want to know how many dislikes there are). We also have 2.5 billion Instagram photos viewed. Knowing a little bit about people’s online habits helps those in marketing and those in sales know where their potential customers are spending their online time. The thing about data is that people often cannot appreciate large numbers. A billion is a number that is too large for us to really picture in our minds. So, you’ll notice a couple of boxes are not labeled. The large blue box represents the number of cups of coffee consumed each day worldwide. As we know, one can get a cup of coffee anywhere in the world. Certainly in North America, there seems to be a coffee shop on every major street corner in any busy city. The brown box on the right side represents the number of votes cast in the 2016 US presidential election and the box in the bottom right corner is the number of books read daily (which should be a little concerning). Image Credits - Kevin Hartman (Hartman (2022)) The point here is that there is a lot of data created every day. The amount of online data created daily far exceeds the amount of daily data created at any other time in the history of the world. Another interesting way to consider the volume of data is to look at how quickly it is growing. Scott Brinker put together his infographic in 2011. Image Credits - Scott Brinker (Brinker (2011)) The graphic consists of company logos in the marketing technology space. He categorized them and showed us the companies in the data space who are making sense of the data being generated. Due to the positive feedback he received, he continues to make these graphics every year. Here is the graphic from 2020. Image Credits - Scott Brinker (Brinker (2022)) Over time, there were 150 companies in the space in 2011. That climbed to 350 in 2012 and continues to climb today where we currently sit around 9,932 companies. Again, there has never been more widely available data. There have never been more companies trying to make sense of the data. If you can’t make sense of data, you will be left behind in the data race. Image Credits - Scott Brinker (Brinker (2022)) 1.2 The Data Story If you want to communicate about your data, you need to tell a story. To tell a story, you need three things: setup, conflict, and resolution. Every story since the beginning of time follows that pattern. You may have heard this pattern in a different way (perhaps: say what you’re going to say, say it, say what you said). In any event, most effective writing falls into this pattern where things are divided into three sections. Call them what you like, the pattern of three is one of the most impactful ways of communicating. Consider your favorite Roadrunner cartoon. In the setup, Wile-e-Coyote constructs an elaborate trap for the Roadrunner at the side of a cliff. During the conflict, Roadrunner runs through the trap and, for some reason, the trap isn’t triggered. The conclusion is when Wile-e-Coyote checks the trap, the trap catches him and he falls off the cliff into a puff of smoke. “Meep meep!” So, what are these parts of the story? The setup is simply a state of affairs. It could be the present state, a past state or a fictitious or future state. It is the setting for the story. The conflict piece describes what changes in the reality. If there is no conflict, there is no story. This is a difficult thing for many people to understand. Authors need to give their audience a reason to care about what they are saying. The conflict portion of the story is how you get your audience to care. Finally, the resolution is what the reality changes into. You can think of it as the new reality. Example: Tell the story of the graph below: Global Inflation Rate From 2000 to 2021, with Forecasts to 2027 Image Credits - Statista ( (n.d.b)) We can begin the story today in 2021. We see inflation is 4.7%. If we use this as the setup, we can then talk about 2 stories - pre 2021 and post 2021. In pre 2021, the conflict occurs in 2008 with a large spike followed by a quick decrease in 2009 and another spike in 2011. The spike in 2008, and the resulting dip and recovery, was due to the global financial crisis. Other than that, there was not much movement in inflation between 2000 and 2021. That’s the story pre 2021. Post 2021, there is projected to be a rather large spike in 2022/23. This is due to the rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine and subsequent war that resulted. This again is an example of the conflict and leads to the new reality that inflation rates will likely be higher for the next couple of years. As you can see from the previous example, the setup does not need to be the reality at the beginning of the data. It can be the reality at whatever point in the data the story is the most compelling. If we had started the story in 2008, the conflict would only have been in 2023 and we would have missed an opportunity to tell a story about the spike in 2008. So, be careful when you’re telling a story. It needs to be rooted in a setup reality that helps you deliver the best and most meaningful message to your audience. One way you can emphasize each of these parts of the story is to separate them on separate graphs. For example, if you want to talk about the war in Ukraine, you might begin by presenting a graph of the inflation changes from 2013 to 2020 as your setup. You can discuss that inflation was fairly steady and that not much changed over those years. You may wish to add in something about the average inflation and how all of those percentages are relatively close to the changing inflation rate. You could also remind people that a small amount of inflation is actually good for the economy and it’s not bad that the inflation rates were between 2.5% and 3.65%. Then, for the conflict, you can show 2021 through 2024 and discuss how the war in Ukraine has caused a spike in the inflation rate. What factors are causing the change? How can we resolve the inflation spike? Finally, this leads us into our new reality in 2025 and beyond. By breaking the story down into parts, you can truly emphasize each part of the story and focus your audience’s attention on the important aspects of the data. Example: Another example of storytelling comes from Andrew Moorfield - a banker who specialized on corproate finance for large banks in the United states. In 2000, Andrew decided to open up his own small business lending company and lanuched bfinance.co.uk. After some time had passed, Andrew had about 25 employees working for him. He found himself in a position in which he couldn’t make payroll. Rather than presenting his staff with all of the numbers in the form of a spreadsheet and telling them what he intended to do, he sat them in the boardroom and wrote 5 numbers on a whiteboard. He wrote down the balance in the bank account at the beginning of the month (X), the revenues the company projected for the month (Y), the costs associated with making those revenues (Z) and the balance in the account at the end of the month (T). This was the setup of Andrew’s story. \\[ \\begin{align*} &amp;X\\\\+&amp;Y\\\\-&amp;Z\\\\ \\hline &amp;T \\end{align*} \\] He then wrote the total salaries of his employees to the right of the T. \\[ \\begin{align*} &amp;X\\\\+&amp;Y\\\\-&amp;Z\\\\ \\hline &amp;T \\;\\;\\;\\;\\; S\\end{align*} \\] Of course, \\(S &gt; T\\). He paused and let the reality of the situation sink in to his employees. This was the conflict. He then asked his staff what they wanted to do to resolve the conflict. They decided amongst themselves to give full salaries to a portion of the staff while deferring the salaries from other members of staff until a later date. They resolved the conflict. By presenting the data in a simple and suscinct way, the staff came up with a resolution to the problem based on a very simple explaination of the data . The moral of the previous example is that there was no reason to over-complicate the data. That is often true when you present data to people who are not intimately familiar with the data. The majority of Andrew’s staff would not have been familiar with the accounting data. Moreover, if Andrew had presented complicated financials, he probably would not have been able to convince his audience to find a simple and effective solution. Story telling matters and the example of bfinance.com.uk demonstrates exactly that. 1.3 Why Data Visualization? As companies make better use of their data, explaining the data becomes increasingly important. Data visualization is a method by which we can communicate qualitative and quantitative data. When creating a visualization, keep in mind the following quotation from Edward Tufte: “Clutter and confusion are not attributes of data - they are shortcomings of design.”. That is to say, when we display data, it needs to be clear, visually appealing and never misleading. A question that one might ask is “why do we need to use data visualization anyway?”. We have all been taught that numbers don’t lie. Perhaps given a data set, all the information we need is stored in the numbers themselves. If this is the way you think about data, you’re half right. Consider the following example. Example: Consider the following 2 data sets: \\[\\begin{matrix} x_1: &amp;4 &amp;6 &amp;4 &amp;4 &amp;4 &amp;3 &amp;4 &amp;8 &amp;8 &amp;4\\\\ x_2: &amp;2 &amp;10 &amp;2 &amp;6 &amp;0 &amp;2 &amp;2 &amp;2 &amp;4 &amp;6 \\end{matrix}\\] What can we say about this data? mean(x1) = 4.9, mean(x2) = 3.6 var(x1) = 3.211, var(x2) = 8.711 corr(x1,x2) = 0.2017 So, remembering back to first year statistics, we know now that the mean of \\(x_1\\) is larger than the mean of \\(x_2\\). So, for each pair, the \\(x_1\\) value tends to be larger. Since the standard deviation of \\(x_2\\) is larger than \\(x_1\\), the values of \\(x_2\\) are more spread out than the values of \\(x_1\\). The positive correlation coefficient indicates that there is a weak positive correlation between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), so if \\(x_1\\) increases, \\(x_2\\) is likely to also increase. We can also take a look at things like the mean and median to determine if there might be some skewness to the data (or better, determine the kurtosis). The previous example gives the impression that we know a fair bit about the data just from a few summary statistics. Indeed, one may find a good amount of information about the data just through those summary statistics. However, those don’t tell the entire story. Example: Consider the following 2 data sets in 2 variables: \\[\\begin{matrix} x_1: &amp;10 &amp;8 &amp;13 &amp;9 &amp;11 &amp;14 &amp;6 &amp;4 &amp;12 &amp;7 &amp;5\\\\ y_1: &amp;8.04 &amp;6.95 &amp;7.58 &amp;8.81 &amp;8.33 &amp;9.96 &amp;7,24 &amp;4.26 &amp;10.84 &amp;4.82 &amp;5.68 \\end{matrix}\\] \\[\\begin{matrix} x_2: &amp;8 &amp;8 &amp;8 &amp;8 &amp;8 &amp;8 &amp;8 &amp;19&amp;8 &amp;8 &amp;8 \\\\ y_2: &amp;6.58 &amp;5.76 &amp;7.71 &amp;8.84 &amp;8.47 &amp;7.04 &amp;5.25 &amp;12.50 &amp;5.56 &amp;7.91 &amp;6.89 \\end{matrix}\\] We compute the same summary statistics for this dataset? You will again find the following: mean(x1) = mean(x2) = 9 mean(y1) = mean(y2) = 7.5 var(x1) = var(x2) = 11 var(y1) = var(y2) = 4.127 cor(x1,y1) = cor(x2,y2) = 0.8164 So, based on the summary statistics, the two data sets are basically the same. They have the same mean x, the same mean y, the same standard deviation for x and for y, and even the correlation between the variables is the same. However, the data sets could not be more different and a quick graph shows us exactly that. x1 &lt;- c(10, 8, 13, 9, 11, 14, 6, 4, 12, 7, 5) y1 &lt;- c(8.04, 6.95, 7.58, 8.81, 8.33, 9.96, 7.24, 4.26, 10.84 , 4.82, 5.68) plot(x1,y1, xlim=c(0,20), ylim=c(0,14)) x2 &lt;- c(8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 19, 8, 8, 8) y2 &lt;- c(6.58, 5.76, 7.71, 8.84, 8.47, 7.04, 5.25, 12.50, 5.56, 7.91, 6.89) plot(x2,y2, xlim=c(0,20), ylim=c(0,14)) The point of the previous example (which is based on the ideas in Anscombe’s quartet ( (2023))) is that the numbers do not tell the entire story. Thus, we need to be very careful how we present data, either in tabular form or in graphical form, to our audience. In the sections that follow, we will present some ideas to help display data in a form that is the most meaningful and helps facilitate correct interpretations. 1.4 Planning the Data Story Now that we know that storytelling is an important part of communicating data, we turn our attention to we deliver the story. Barbara Minto, a former consultant for McKinsey, developed a concept referred to as the Minto Pyramid Principal. Minto Pyramid Principal: Any statement that is made must be supported by facts; moreover, the statement must be a perfect summation of those facts. In order to achieve success with this principal, we use three of Minto’s rules. First, the most important statement that we make must be a good summarization of the elements (or facts) that we’re using below it to support that statement. Next, these facts should be all similar in some way. Finally, the order that we present these facts should be in an order that is not surprising to our audience. We want to make sure that they make sense to the audience. To that end, we could order them from largest to smallest or we could list them chronologically, or in some other sensible order. Together these facts should be mutually exclusive (having no overlap) and collectively exhaustive (fully supports the objective). If you are able to achieve this type of structure, you have a well organized point. You can combine multiple pyramids to create the full story for your audience. Image Credits - Barbara Minto (Minto and Minto (1996)) This type of structure can also help when you construct research questions. What is the overarching objective? What key-questions must we answer in order to fully evaluate the objective? This will help guide what data we need and even where we might find it. Image Credits - Adam Amran ( (n.d.a)) 1.5 Enriching The Story Data is hard and numbers are confusing to most people. There are some techniques that we can use to take some of the mystery out of explaining this data to people. As an example, consider that the US consumes 7,117,500,000 barrels of crude oil annually. That is a fact; however, it is difficult to visualize what that looks like. The context is missing. While the figure seems large, we do not have any emotional connection to it. The idea of millions or billions is lost on most people, so we need to reframe the context. John Kenney has developed five different ways to frame or position numbers to help the audience make a connection. 1.5.1 Use of Units The use of units is important. Use units that people understand. For example, the idea of 7.1 billion barrels of crude oil is difficult to understand. However, it is enough oil to make 36 billion plastic water bottles every day. Even though we use billions here, we have tied that number to something our audience understands. Everyone knows what a water bottle looks like and it is difficult to imagine 36 billion of those each day. 1.5.2 Use Familiar Comparisons A familiar comparison can be an effective way to communicate difficult to understand concepts. Going back to the crude oil example, we can explain that 7.1 billion barrels of crude oil is enough for 39 trips to the sun and back each day. In our minds, we know the sun is a long ways away. While we do not think of it in kilometers, we know that making 39 round trips is enormous. Another comparison could be around time. Americans use about 225 barrels of oil each second. Here, while we may not know exactly what 225 barrels of oil looks like, we do understand the idea of 1 second. Using 225 barrels of anything in 1 second seems like a lot. 1.5.3 Use Everyday Terms Comparing the number to something that we do daily is a great way to connect the audience to a large number. While we know that driving uses oil and that heating our homes uses oil, the processes associated with these is not necessarily obvious to most people. However, we know how much water we use. It turns out that Americans use 48 times more oil than water every day. Since we understand our use of water (to drink, water the lawn, wash the dishes or clothes), knowing that there is almost 50 times more oil being used than water being consumed is crazy. 1.5.4 Use the Moral or Emotional Approach A rather risky approach is to use something that elicits an emotional or moral reaction from the audience. For example, in less than four decades, the world’s finite supply of oil will be gone forever. Now, the issue here is that this can have a polarizing impact on your audience. Make sure you know your audience well enough to ensure that you don’t alianate any of them and risk them shutting down. 1.5.5 Use a Personal Approach Again, this approach takes the message back to each audience member. A typical American family uses 70 barrels of oil. While I don’t know what 70 barrels looks like, it does strike me as a rather large amount that my family would be using. In this example, 70 barrels for a household seems very high and possibly even gluttonous. So, if your point is to persuade people to reduce, this might be very impactful. These techniques will help establish an emotional connection with the audience and will help us either persuade them or connect with them. It helps bring meaning to our story. Graphics are often bad at conveying emotion. These comparisons will help bring in the necessary emotion. 1.6 Best Practices Obviously, there are many opinions on what constitutes best practices. Use what follows as a guide. 1.6.1 Select Your Audience When creating visualizations, consider the audience. Who is the audience? Who will be looking at this data? What are the challenges they face and what prevents them from overcoming those challenges? Do not create a visualization that meets everyone’s needs; but rather, consider the needs of a smaller group of stakeholders. 1.6.2 Know Your Purpose When selecting your graphic, consider why you are doing so. What conclusion do I want the audience to draw? Are there decisions (strategic, operational or tactical) that need to be made and how does my visualization help drive those decisions? Do not simply include a visualization without a goal in mind. Stakeholders need to be able to use your visualization to make decisions and in an appropriate time-frame to align with decision types. Once a visualization is clear, insights can be drawn and action can be taken. What actions do I want people to take with this insight? Consider how your visualization will drive action. If there are thresholds that need to be achieved or comparisons to be made, how will you include those in your visualizations? 1.6.3 Select the Right Visual Accountants like tables - everyone else likes visuals. However, selecting the correct chart type is not trivial. We will discuss different types of graphs in another chapter.

Studying history can often be insightful and can help illuminate the core foundation upon which this important topic in data science is built. Seeing what innovative ways people used visualization will hopefully inspire you to be innovative yourself. Finally, we hope that this historical perspective provides inspiration. Consider that it took until the 1800’s to invent the scatterplot. What future plots and techniques might we still be able to discover? We characterize the evolution of data visualization in eight epochs (Friendly (2006)). The paper “A Brief History of Data Visualization” (Friendly (2006)) is a great place to find additional information on the history of data visualization. 2.1 Epoch I - Pre-17th Century: Early Maps and Diagrams Indeed, the history of data visualization can be traced back to nearly the beginning of time. In the first epoch, pre 1600, humans were using maps to make sense of their surroundings. By making maps, this allowed people to share information about their surroundings with each other ( (n.d.c)). While these maps tended to be imprecise, the information they were able to convey was still valuable. Image Credits - BBC Data Science Art Project ( (n.d.c)) The Tabula Peutinger is a Roman map used to move and position armies. It shows the road system of the empire beginning in Britain in the west and finishing in India in the East. In addition to geographical visualizations, people were using visualizations to collect information about planets. Here is a graph indicating the position of the sun, moon and planets. Image Credits - Funkhouser, 1936 (Dix and Ellis (1998)) 2.2 Epoch II - 1600 - 1699: Measurement and Theory The second epoch begins in the 1600’s around the beginning of the scientific revolution. During this epoch, many of the core values of scientific thinking were established, specifically, this epoch is characterized by precise measurement. Around this era, problems concerned with physical measurement of time, distance and space were among the most important. Thanks in part to the contributions of Descartes and Fermat, this century saw the rise of analytic geometry. Pascal and Fermat also gave us the beginning of probability theory. Christopher Scheiner created a visual telling the story of sun spots. Scheiner, a priest, studied sun spots in an attempt to reconcile Church teachings that the Cosmos had no imperfections with the visual evidence that it did. The image shows sunspots from October 23 through December 19, 1611. One can see the seven sunspots identified in the key in the upper left corner of the visual and the corresponding spots in the lower images. Image Credits - Scheiner, 1630 (Carrasco et al. (2022)) Michael Florent van Langren was a Flemish astronomer who produced what is widely believed to be the first visual representation of statistical data(Tufte (1997)). Here, he displays the 12 known estimates of the difference in longitude between Toledo and Rome. While this data could be very simply be shown in a table, his use of a graphic illustrates the wide range in variation between the estimates. The middle of the range (a gap in which he inscribed “ROMA”) was his estimate of the true longitude. Incidentally, the true longitude is \\(16^o30&#39;\\) as depicted by the arrow at the bottom of the graphic. This graphic also was an early example of one in which we have negated the effect of ordering bias in a visualization. Image Credits - Tufte, 1997 (Tufte (1997)) During this epoch, we also see the first bivariate plot of a theoretical curve relating barometric pressure to altitude as well as the first known weather map of wind (Sridharan (2017)).

The goal of this data collection, termed “political arithmetic”, was to gain insight in matters related to wealth, agriculture, land, population, taxes, etc. Some of this data was used for the purposes of annuities and insurance and came about by way of life tables. By the end of the century, all of the necessary elements for visual thinking were beginning to fall into place. 2.3 Epoch III - 1700 - 1799: New Graphical Forms In the third epoch, artists are beginning to explore different visual forms and creative forms of communicating data in an attempt to quickly generate insights. Specifically, timelines, cartograms, functional interpolations, line graphs, and bar charts were established and being put to use. Additionally, contour and topographical maps began to show up. During this time period, three-colour printing was invented thus bringing about an additional mode to encode data. The cost of replication, however, made wide circulation impossible. 2.4 Epoch IV - 1800 - 1850: Beginnings of Modern Graphics Epoch four is the beginning of modern graphics. By this point, all of the major forms of data display have been invented: line, bar, and pie charts, histograms, time-series, contour, and scatter plots, etc. From cartography, maps evolved to atlases involving a wide range of symbolism and dealing with a variety of topics (economic data, medical data, etc.). Geological maps made their first appearance at the beginning of the century. These types of diagrams began to regularly appear in scientific papers, too. William Playfair introduced this graph which depicts the price of wheat juxtaposed with the change in wages. Visuals produced with this data allowed for the study of economic problems. Playfair also was one of the first to experiment with composing multiple graphs to determine relationships between variables. Image Credits - Sankaran (Sankaran (2021)) During 1931, the first case of cholera occurred in Great Britain with over 52,000 deaths in the ensuing epidemic. Dr. John Snow and Dr. Robert Baker both studied the phenomena. Baker created a map of cholera showing the districts of Leeds impacted by cholera during the 1832 outbreak. Baker’s map did not lead to any answers about how to treat or cure cholera. At the time, it was unknown how the disease was transmitted. Baker shaded the 1800 cholera cases which were divided into “the districts in which the cholera had prevailed.” There was a note in his report pointing out the association between the disease and living conditions: “how exceedingly the disease has prevailed in those parts of the town where there is a deficiency, often an entire want of sewage, drainage, and paving” (Gilbert (1958)). However, there were not incidence rates nor data about population density on the map. This left his conclusions weak. Image Credits - Gilbert (Gilbert (1958)) Fast forward a few years, toward the end of epoch 4 and the beginning of epoch 5, and Dr. John Snow produced a graph of Cholera cases with each death marked by a dot. The dots appear clustered around the Broad Street pump in London leading to both the discovery that the pump was causing the spread of cholera and that, in general, cholera is spread by liquid. Image Credits - Gilbert (Gilbert (1958)) 2.5 Epoch V - 1850 - 1900: The Golden Age of Statistical Graphics The fifth epoch is the golden age of data analytics. This begins in the mid 19th century. We attribute this epoch with artists collecting data and using visualizations to communicate the data. It is a transition from an era filled with enthusiasm to the golden age. We find John Snow’s cholera graphic right on the border of these epoch 4 and 5. Florence Nightingale’s illustration of the need for greater sanitary conditions among the British army. In her visualization, we clearly see that more soldiers died from disease and the consequences of wounds than in the battles themselves. These were but a few examples of the innovations in graphical design that were invented over this period. Image Credits - Sankaran (Sankaran (2021)) We also see the visual telling the story of Napoleon’s march to Moscow and then return home. This visual shows the number of soldier lives lost, the temperature and the distance traveled. Image Credits - Sankaran (Sankaran (2021)) Francis Galton, well known for his work in correlation and regression, helped develop statistical insight from visualizations. He noted that in a normal distribution, the isolines of equal frequency would appear as concentric ellipses and that the locus of the regression lines of the means of \\(y|x\\) and \\(x|y\\) were the conjugate diameters of these ellipses. Galton’s work extended to notable non-statistical graphical discoveries such of those involving counter-clockwise patterns of winds around low-pressure regions combined with clockwise rotataions around high-pressure zones. This work is summarized in Meteorographica (1863) (Galton (1863)). However, one of the most important works of this epoch was the Albums de Statistique Graphique published by the French ministry of public works (1879 – 1897). Under the direction of Emile Cheysson, these large format books (11 x 17 in) contained a multitude of economic and financial data related to planning and development. Most significanly, this book can be seen as an overview of the various graphical techniques known at the time. However, among the many beautiful stories, there are some issues in this epoch. Toward the end of the century, the Albums de Statistique Graphique were discontinued due to the high production costs. In some cases, visuals become too complicated for interpretation. In other cases, the graphics overwrite the story of the data. 2.6 Epoch VI: 1900-1950: The Modern Dark Ages After the fifth epoch, a bit of a revolution begins. There were few innovations during this period. Formal models supplanted the enthusiasm for visualization which was so plentiful during the late 1800s. We can classify this epoch as the modern dark ages of data analytics. During this era, academics revolt in an attempt for more accuracy, control and a standardized language. Creativity for the sake of creativity is limited and a push for accuracy is introduced. However, during this period, we find that the population gains an overall acceptance of graphical techniques. Graphics become mainstream. They begin showing up in English textbooks, in commerce and in science. Indeed, Sir Arthur Bowley’s textbook (1901) Elements of Statistics (Bowley (1901)) devoted two chapters to the construction and dissemination of graphs and diagrams. These chapters deal with visual elements such as scale, visual estimates of differences and ratios, smoothing of graphs, 3D graphics and multiple plots overlayed on the same graph. One example is Arthur Bowley’s graph depicting several exponential smoothings of a time series graph showing a 10-year trend in exports. Image Credits - Bowley, 1901 (Bowley (1901)) A push for standardization in graphs culminated in a set of standards and rules for graphical presentation adopted by the Joint Committee on Standards for Graphic Presentation in 1914. 2.7 Epoch VII - 1950 - 1975: The Re-birth of Data Visualization Three significant developments occurred during the mid 1900’s which shaped the rebirth of data visualization during this era. First John W. Tukey published a landmark paper titled The Future of Data Analysis (1962) in which he issued a call for the recognition of data analysis as a branch of statistics. He also invented what he called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This consisted of a number of graphs (stem-leaf plots, boxplots, hanging rootograms, two-way table displays etc.) that quickly became commonplace. Next, Jacques Bertin published Semiologie Graphique (1967). This paper is the data visualization of the periodic table in that it organized visual and perceptual elements of graphics according to features and relations in data. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, computer processing of statistical data began. FORTRAN, one of the first computer languages, is developed in 1957. By the late 1960s, mainframe computers were widely available at many universities. This lead to the ability to construct graphs by computer program. Indeed, statistical applications became available (though, they were not yet widespread). As a result, more data can be analyzed in more sophisticated ways. We are able to add different graphical elements that we didn’t have previously. By the end of the period, there were the beginnings of collaborative computer science research, developments in data analysis and new display and input technology. We begin to hear of ideas related to new ways to visualize multivariate data, the development of dimension reduction techniques and perceptually based theory of graphical attributes. 2.8 Epoch VIII - 1975 - Today: High Definition and Dynamic Visualization Today’s epoch can be called high-definition data analytics where visuals are now almost always created with the assistance of computers. We take advantage of all of the insights we learned from past epochs to create very powerful visuals. Indeed, visualizations now have surpassed human creativity. A few recent highlights include the development of interactive graphics, new methods for visualizing highly dimensional data, the application of visualization techniques to a growing list of problems and an increased focus on how data is perceived. Of course, these developments are substantially aided by advances in statistical software such as R, SAS, Python, Power BI, etc. A substantial increase in computer speed has aided these software. We have also seen advances in classical statistics in which we move toward wider domains. Indeed, statistics has evolved to the point where it requires a new name - Data Science. While statistics and data science are not the same, there is substantial overlap. Colloquially, data science involves the collection, organization, analysis and visualization of data (typically, large amounts of data) while statistics typically uses mathematical models to quantify relationships between variables and outcomes and makes predictions based on those relationships. 2.9 Today’s Data Visualization Tools There is a very quickly changing and dynamic market for visualization tools. For simplicity, one way to consider the market for data visualization tools is to evaluate them in terms of ease of use and of capability. Ask yourself if the tool is simple to use and simple to learn. Can I quickly get the tool to do what I want it to do. In this way, ease of use is important. Assessing the capability is a bit different. Some tools do one specific task very well. Others are useful for a variety of tasks. So, one might need to weigh the capability of one tool against a set of different tools that accomplish the same tasks. Is broad better than specific? It truly depends on the tool. Image Credits - Kevin Hartman (Hartman (2022)) These tools are laid out on the graphic above. Clearly, there are four quadrants in this figure. The upper left quadrant is filled with tools that are easy to use but limited in scope. These tools might be appropriate for one-off tasks. For example, Wordle is a very easy to use software that creates word clouds. You need almost no training to use it; however, it does nothing other than word clouds. The upper right quadrant is full of tools that are both powerful and easy to use. Products like Plotly and Power BI are both fairly powerful and relatively simple to use. These types of products should be your default tools - tools that you use for everyday visualizations. Try to spend 75% of your time with products in this quadrant. In the lower right quadrant, we find tools that are incredibly powerful but quite difficult to learn. So, the power we get from the tool is offset by the awkward nature or the difficult learning curve. While these tools may require some time to learn, they tend to be incredibly powerful. Some of these tools are among the most important tools for you to know how to use. The bottom left quadrant is filled with software that is both limited in scope and difficult to use. These tools really do not need your attention. Typically, these tools can be replaced with something that is at the same level of difficulty but much more powerful, or something that is just as limited in scope, but is much simpler to use. One thing we need to do is remember that the market for analytics tools is ever-changing. Thus, remain flexible and as the market changes, be prepared to change as well. You can’t stay on top of all of the different tools; however, do some investigation and see what tools might work best for you. Replace less powerful and difficult to use tools with simple powerful tools. "],["think-data-ink.html", "Chapter 3 Think Data Ink 3.1 Data Ink 3.2 Tables 3.3 Graphics 3.4 Exercises", " Chapter 3 Think Data Ink 3.1 Data Ink Data ink is the amount of ink, in a printed table or graph, used to display the data. Non-data ink is the amount of ink in a printed table or graph that does not contribute to displaying the data. Edward Tufte’s guiding principle is that when you display data, you want the highest possible data-ink ratio. Definition: The data-ink ratio is the amount of ink used to display data as a ratio or percentage of the ink used in the graphic overall. Mathematically, we can think of the data-ink ratio as \\(\\begin{align*} \\text{Data-Ink Ratio} &amp;= \\dfrac{\\text{Amount of ink used to display the data}}{\\text{Total amount of ink used in the graphic}}\\\\ \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\text{the proportion of the graphic that can be erased}. \\end{align*}\\) Tufte argues that the closer this ratio is to 1 (or 100%), the better the graphic is and clearly, this can be achieved by removing unnecessary parts of the graph or table. One should be careful, however. The data-ink ratio is somewhat fictitious and very difficult to actually calculate. Rather, it serves as a guide for how to create graphs and tables. It is a state of mind rather than a number that is to be calculated. We want graphics that display data and have very little else included. To that end, Tufte proposed five guiding principles related to data-ink (Tufte (2001): Above all else, show data. Maximize the data-ink ratio. Erase non-data-ink. Erase redundant data-ink. Revise and edit. 3.2 Tables The ideas from Tufte apply equally to tables and graphs. Tables list records and consist of rows and columns. Tables can show a lot of information in a structured way but may overwhelm people especially when the goal is to flush out trends. To that end, apply Tufte’s principles to tables. Avoid extra gridlines. Increase the data-ink ratio by removing any lines that do not add to the overall readability of the table. Right align numbers to show differences in magnitudes. This is a simple way to have a quasi stem and leaf plot embed in your table. Left align words in a column. This simply keeps words separate from numbers. Align column headers with the data. That is, right align column headers for numbers and left align column headers for words. Round your numbers to a place that makes sense. Accountants need more significant digits than managers typically. Consider cross-tabulation rather than clean data. While long data is very useful for analysis, wide data is often easier to us to tell a story. Keep aesthetics of the rows and columns consistent. If you have different widths, fonts, typefaces or colour, the reader is drawn to those rows or columns. Adding different aesthetics should be done only when you wish to draw people’s attention to those attributes. Often 0’s can be removed if the 0 represents an NA. They can be replaced by a hyphen. Sort the table in a sensible way. Alphabetical order is ALMOST NEVER the best way to sort a table. Sorting by a total will increase the ease of quick comparisons. Example: The table below is courtasy of SimplexCT and is available here. Image Credits - Case Problems in Finance, 10th edition This table shows all of the data required to investigate short-term credit provided to a multinational company by various banks. However, it is busy and difficult to pull any coherent story from. We can clean this up using Tufte’s principles: Create consistent row height and column widths. Right align all numbers so the reader can quickly see differences in size. Right align column labels for columns of numerical data. Remove background colours and unnecessary gridlines. Remove bold and italics typeface. Remove redundant labels. This includes changing 0.0 to -. Increase the font size of the data and reduce the font size of the labels. Sort the rows of the data by grand total in decreasing order. Sort the columns of the data by Total for each country. We moved the row total to the top. We also moved the Grand Total column next to the row label. This tells the story of which banks we have the most credit with and how that credit is broken down. Add breaks and a tint every 5 rows to enhance readability. The final table is below. Image Credits - Case Problems in Finance, 10th edition The previous example demonstrates that even a fairly normal looking table can be improved by a few small changes. Indeed, most of what we changed in the previous example were put there intentionally by the table designer. Don’t waste time adding unnecessary design elements to a graph; rather, keep it minimalist and help your audience to understand the data rather than admire your creativity. Example: The table below has a low data-ink ratio. Fix the table so that it has a higher data-ink ratio and is easier to read. To fix this table, we can do the following: Remove the gridlines. Group the subjects into class types and group classes of the same type together. Group STEM classes separate from English and History Order columns by student GPA Groupings add natural breaks between subjects, so there is no need to add shading. Calculate student GPA at the bottom. Highlight this total with a different colour or a horizontal line. Depending on the story, you may wish to include other features. If we are telling a story about which students had the highest GPA, we may wish to move the Student Average row to the top. We may also chose to highlight (with bold face) the student who did the best in each class or the class that a particular student did the best in. We may require subtotal averages for each subject area or the average GPA in each subject area. All of these features depend on what story we want to tell the reader. 3.3 Graphics We have seen how the data-ink ratio, and Tufte’s other principles, can be used to create effective tables. We now turn our attention to applying these principles to graphs. Below is a graph that does not closely follow Tufte’s principles. Image Credits - Tim Bray (Becker (n.d.)) The graph above is full of what we call “chart junk”. There is background colour, there are too many grid lines, and the extra additions distract from the message of the chart. Removing the extra gridlines and background colour make the chart much more focused on the data. Adding whitespace where the horizontal lines would have been allows the reader to quickly identify the rough height of each bar. Image Credits - Tim Bray (Becker (n.d.)) All told, this histogram removes the distractions and lets the reader focus on the data and the story. Remember, the harder your audience needs to work to understand the chart, the less they are paying attention to what you’re saying. Example: The point of the following graphic is to convey which sports stadium is the loudest. Which stadium is the loudest and by how much (a lot or a little)? Image Credits - Playfair Data (Sleeper (2019)) The takeaway to most casual observers is that Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City is the loudest of the five by a fairly wide margin (look at the stadium pictures - it is a wide margin, clearly). Below is the same graphic, transformed with the principles of Tufte. It shows a much different story. Image Credits - Playfair Data (Sleeper (2019)) Arrowhead Stadium is still the loudest. However, the difference between Arrowhead Stadium (the loudest) and TurkTelekom Satdium (the 5th loudest) is fairly negligable. The extraneous bells and whistles in the first graphic distort the message which should be that there is not much difference between the five loudest stadiums in the world (&lt; 10% difference). 3.4 Exercises Show that the 4 datasets that comprise the Anscombe’s Quartet data have the same mean for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the same standard deviation for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and that the correlation between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same across the 4 datasets. Plot the 4 data sets to show that the pictures are different. The datasets can be found here. Duplicate the analysis in the previous question using the DatasauRus data set found here. Recreate the table in the “Student Grades” example to tell the story of “Which classes are the easiest”. Recreate the table in the “Student Grades” example to tell the story of “Which classes are students scoring over 80% in”. Recreate the table in the “Student Grades” example to tell the story of “Which students are in academic trouble”. "],["planning-your-visualization.html", "Chapter 4 Planning Your Visualization 4.1 When a Visualization Hits our Eyes 4.2 Two Questions You Should Ask 4.3 Planning", " Chapter 4 Planning Your Visualization Once we have data, the next task is to select the appropriate graphic. Obviously, using visualizations will capture some patterns that are not easily seen through tabular data. A fantastic reference for this is a book by Scott Berinato titled “Good Charts” (Berinato (2016)). 4.1 When a Visualization Hits our Eyes Berinato (Berinato (2016))introduces five ideas we should all be familiar with when it comes to visualization. The first is that, in contrast to reading and writing, visualizations do not work left to right and top to bottom. That is, we do not take in visual data the same way we take in written data. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Rather, in a visualization, readers explore the data based on other factors. Factors like size, shape, colour, etc. influence where our eyes are initially drawn. The title, for example, may not be the first or even second part of the chart that we see. We also pace differently when we read a visualization as compared to a book. We do not spend the same amount of time on each part of the graphic as opposed to spending a similar amount of time on each sentence. Our eyes go where they are drawn and we spend as much time as we wish. This would also imply that those more accustomed to reading visualizations will take in visual information differently than those with little experience. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) The next idea Berinato introduces is the idea of catching the reader’s eye with the most important part of the visualization. Berinato points out that “[w]e see first what stands out” (Berinato (2016)). Our eyes, by their very nature, are drawn to change. Changes can come in a variety of forms including colour, peaks, valleys, outliers etc. The best charts are so simple that we understand them without knowing anything about their context. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) This chart contains an intersection. This likely was the first thing your eye was drawn toward. You (likely) may have not even bothered initially to see the year of the intersection. More likely, you saw the crossover, checked the chart labels, read the title and concluded that more people currently live in urban areas compared to rural areas. Berinato gives the following example. What do you see first? Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) For most people, the peak, the blue line and the horizontal outage line are the first things that they see. So, if the idea you are trying to convey has to do with those things, this is likely a successful graph. If the idea was to convey that customer service has been in decline and the decline has little or nothing to do with the outage, this graph probably does not tell the correct story. If you are trying to tell the story of declining customer service, the data related to the outage is irrelevant and only complicates the diagram. Moreover, if the decline is largely unrelated to the service outage, perhaps adding a line that shows when service is restored would help tell the story that the outage was not the issue. Showing that the decline continues to occur after the service is restored speaks to unhappy customers even after everything is back to normal. Finally, the new title makes the idea clear. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) The third point that Berinato brings forward is that it is impossible to see a large number of things simultaneously. In this first diagram, we see a very nice graph indicating the increase in performance from the entire team. Their ratings all seem to increase. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) However, it is impossible to see individual employees within the mess. Rather, the second graph shows the overall trend of the group as well as a few particular employees. The use of shade here allows us to easily see a few key individuals. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) The fourth idea made by Berinato is that it is natural for us to seek meaning and connections. When thinking back to the original graph about declining customer service, how many of us initially tried to make a connection between the blue line and the shaded peak. It turns out that there was none. But, that was the first thing many of us tried. The point is that it is most people’s natural inclination to do so. Of course, there are some advantages of having this attribute. We process visual information far more effectively than we do written information. For example, if your apartment building is on fire, written instructions are far less appropriate than a quick map. The map below is far simpler than a written description of the plan. Consider what the written directions would be to get out of the building and how many of them you would need for each room compared to a diagram. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Making sure that we don’t accidentally create unintended associations in the information is vital. Consider the graph below. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Here, the use of colour might accidentally cause people to associate orange dots with top performers even though the use of that colour was done so without meaning. Team A clearly out performs Team B and every aspect of the graph should point to that fact. The final point made by Berinato is that people tend to rely on conventions and not on metaphors. We rely on having seen previous graphs to give us insight as to what is happening in the graph we’re currently looking at. The graph below is the customer service graph with the axis swapped. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) What you might notice is that it takes significantly longer to determine what is happening. We expect a numerical axis to be vertical and a categorical or time series axis to be horizontal. The point here is that it takes a lot of effort to determine what the graph says. Having the client spend time trying to decipher the graph takes time away from then listening to you present it. Conventions come from expectation and our brain uses experiences and expectations as cognitive shortcuts so that we don’t need to process everything. Similarly, we would have the same reaction if someone showed us a map of the world where north was down and south was up. While there is no “right side up” when it comes to an object floating in space. Other conventions are that red is “hot” or “active” while blue is “cold” or “inactive”. Light shades are considered empty while darker ones are full. Here is a little subtler example. If we dig in, what initially appears to be a well constructed pie chart is actually quite problematic. We are forcing people to work harder than they need to in order to understand the data. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) We make the following connections without considering them: Like colours mean like items - blue things should go together. Colour saturation indicates higher and lower values - light colours should have less value than dark ones. Categories should go from one extreme to the other - make the order of the key sensible. It is an interesting exercise to remake this graph using correct conventions. By looking at the chart as it is, consider if you can answer the following question quickly: what group makes up the majority - Interested or not interested? Compare it to the graph below. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) By not following convention, you risk your audience not trusting your ability. The chart will not be judged negatively - you will. 4.2 Two Questions You Should Ask When you begin the process of constructing a visualization, two questions are important to ask (Berinato (2016)): Is the information data-driven or conceptual? Is this an exploratory analysis or am I declaring something? We begin with the first question. If your information is conceptual, you likely want to focus on ideas with a goal of teaching. Conceptual visualizations can be things like Org-charts, cycle diagrams, blue prints, road maps, or concept map type visuals. These visuals tend to give a message or create a direction for future work rather than having anything to do with data. If your visual is data driven, you are likely to rely on statistical techniques with a goal of informing your audience. While these visuals can sometimes be conceptual, they are always rooted in some sort of measured value. Typical statistical graphs are great examples of data driven visualizations. The second question asks if the visual meant for exploratory analysis or is it declarative. If it is exploratory, the focus is likely on prototyping. It will be an iterative process where you will find yourself adding and subtracting from the visual. It is often a process of discovery, too. Declarative visualizations are often seen as the final product of an analysis. They are often what managers aim for when they ask for an analysis. They focus on documenting the analysis with a goal of affirmation or persuasion. It is important to note that oftentimes exploratory graphs end up as declarative graphs by the end, through the process of refinement. We combine the two questions in a 2 x 2 grid as we so often do. Image Credits - Daniel Mullins (International and Mullins (2017)) If your chart is declarative and conceptual, it is referred to as idea illustration. These types of visuals illustrate process and framework. They should be clear and simple in nature and are often metaphorical (ie, think of visuals with funnels). Often used for presentations and teaching, they focus on simplifying concepts. A visual that is conceptual and exploratory is referred to idea generation. It is a little like brainstorming. We come up with ideas and see if they stick. Information here tends to be complex and so requires creative, often metaphorical, visualization features. These types of visuals are often seen in brainstorming sessions with a goal of discovery, simplification or learning. Think of these diagrams like “napkin drawings” or “whiteboard drawings”. Visualizations that are data driven and exploratory are those made in an EDA. These are often the most complicated type of visual. We do not know what the story is yet, but we want to use data visualizations to find out. It is important to flush out patterns and generate hypothesis in this quadrant. Normally, we will look for patterns, of which there are five: Change Clustering Relativity Ranking Correlation Each of these reveal a story and each of them have a variety of visualizations associated with them. For example, a line graph is a nice way to illustrate change over time. Relativity might be best viewed with a bar chart. The moral here is that once we know what we’re looking at, we can pick the appropriate chart to augment the story. A declarative and data-driven visualization occurs when we know what the story is and we want to communicate the story. This is what we do regularly and so it is referred to as everyday dataviz. Normally, the data here is fairly simple and is shown using conventional charts. These visualizations are best when they are clear and simple and are presented with a goal of affirming or setting context. Remember, presenting this type of visual will often require a story. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Remember, each of these visualization types is important. You are likely to use everyday viz and visual discover about 70% of the time, with idea illustration and generation the remaining 30%. As new software emerges, these numbers will likely change. Taking a few minutes and asking yourself the two questions will often save you significant time as you create your visual. This truly is a case where using a dash of prevention at the beginning will save you from having to take a cup of remedy in the end. 4.3 Planning Planning is essential when putting together client ready visualizations. The level of polish and detail is much higher for a final visualization than it is for a visual that we would make for an EDA. Remember, the client will not judge the graph - they will judge you. So, it’s important that you ratchet up the level of effort for final visualizations. Consider a typical hour used to create a strong visual. That hour can roughly be divided into 4 regions: prep, talk and listen, sketch and prototype (Berinato (2016)). 4.3.1 Preparation During the prep phase, perhaps the first 5 minutes or so of your hour, you should put the data aside. While it is important to understand the data, having the data drive the visual is very limiting. Oftentimes, you end up converting a table into a table in visual form. Here is an example from Berinato where an e-commerce business sketches a quick graph of sales over the course of the day. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) While not a bad first pass, this is a simple conversion of data from a table to a graph. Since the business operates in the Eastern timezone, all of the data is normalized to Eastern time. That is, the time here is not given in the timezone of the purchaser as it is in the graph below. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) This graphic is much more useful as it shows that the majority of the transactions for the company occur between 8AM and 10PM local time. The message given by the graph is much different in the second than in the first (and I would argue, much more informative). So, before you begin, write down some basic things: Who is this visual for? What will you call it? Why do you need it? Where will you present it? Which of the four types of charts are you creating? 4.3.2 Talk and Listen Of all the things you can do to improve your chart, talking and listening is probably the most important. This phase might take 15 minutes of your hour. Find a friend or coworker and discuss the chart with them. Tell them why you made the decisions you made. Discuss if this will work for the intended audience. This will force you to organize yourself and your thoughts. Though these conversations are awkward at first, they get easier. Tell them what you are working on, what you are trying to show and why the story is important. The next part is important - listen to what they say and what questions they ask. Likely, these are the same questions that your final audience will have. Remember, you are close to the data. Make sure that the message of your visual is obvious to someone who isn’t close to the data. 4.3.3 Sketch The next 20 minutes should be spent constructing a sketch by hand. There are many handy charts aimed at assisting in selecting the correct visualization. This one, by Andrew Albela, is a great example. Image Credits - Andrew Albela (Arpi (2021)) While it may be missing some graphs (and includes pie charts), it is a great place to begin. This type of guide might help us move away from always using bar and line graphs for everything. Be careful, however, as new types of charts are being designed all the time. Do not let yourself be pigeonholed into always using the same type of chart simply based on a recommendation. Take some time to research new graphs and put them in your tool box. A good exercise is to take the chart types that Albela suggests in his diagram and try to see which ones might work for each of the 4 quadrants of visualization types (declarative/ exploratory vs conceptual/ data-driven). Once you have selected your visualization type, sketch it by hand. You should always try two different chart types. Suppose you want to compare income with the price of Apple products. You may initially begin with a sketch like this. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) This chart would be perfectly fine. However, if you try a second type of visualization, you might actually stumble across something better. Consider a mini-treemap. Image Credits - Berinato (Berinato (2016)) This shows much clearer the ratio of income that would be spent on the product. Ultimately, your second, third, fourth, etc. sketch may not be better than the original. However, sketching various charts will definitely help clarify your thoughts and your message when you construct your final visual. We will discuss different types of visualizations in the next chapter. 4.3.4 Prototype The final 20 minutes of our hour is spent prototyping. You know you’re ready for this stage because your sketch matches what you are trying to say very closely, you’re putting in actual data rather than just “faking it” and you generally are running out of ideas. The prototype stage is iterative. You create, you refine, you create some more, etc. You should experiment with colour, size, shape, etc. There is lots of software out there that can help at this step. Don’t be afraid to experiment to find what works best for your situation.

In this chapter, we will go over some of the basic chart types and what the best practices are for each. 5.1 Simple Text When you are trying to communicate a number or two, consider just stating the number. Make it prominent with few words to help it. When using a table or chart in instances with few numbers, the message tends to fall flat. Example: Consider the following data. The data came from a report from Pew Research Center. The idea was that few children had stay-at-home moms in 2012. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) In this example, we have too much text. There is lots of wasted space and only really two numbers. In addition, if the message is that 20% is small, that does not come across as the right bar seems to be almost half of the height of the chart. (Of course, we know that 20% is less than half of 41% and that 41% is less than 50% to begin with, but is this the best way to drive your point home?) A better way is below. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) Another note, avoid a graphic that says that there are fewer than 50% of stay-at-home mothers in 2012 compared to 1970 as without the reference to the 41%, some of the context is lost. 5.2 Tables Avoid using tables in presentations. As the audience attempts to read the table, the focus switches from you to the table. In reports, however, tables are often the way to go. When reading reports, the audience has much more time to digest the message and they can do so at their own pace without worrying about the typed message being lost. Borders should be used only when their inclusion adds to the legibility of your table. If you must have them, consider grey borders. A border separating the column labels from the data is allowed. However, try to use white space to separate rows and columns where possible. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Example: The first table below is a standard “Microsoft Excel” looking table. Consider how we might clean it up. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) When arranging data, consider what your columns and row labels should be. Consider using groupings and repeat column/ row headers at the beginning of each group. This keeps the structure consistent from group to group. When formatting text, all text should be oriented horizontally and in a sensible left to right order. Never order your data at random (alphabetically is very close to random in many cases). Align numbers to the right and ensure that the same number of decimal places are kept for each number. Non-numerical values should be left aligned (with the possible exception of centering non-numeric items with the same number of characters). Select a font that is legible and maintain the same font throughout. Using bold typeface or colour is useful if you want to highlight groups. Make columns containing group summaries visually distinct from the detail columns. Consider putting summaries at the top of a group rather than at the bottom. Including a chart in a table if space is available. It often increases the message. Example: This example has a bar graph with the numerical data included. The eye is immediately drawn to the graph. Including the graph will highlight the important parts of the data. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) 5.3 Heatmap A heatmap is a way to enhance a table. Rather than having to scan the table to find high and low values, the colour saturation helps us target key numbers quickly. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) Example: Heatmaps can be useful for time series tables. Here we use a heatmap to highlight utilization rates. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) 5.4 Scatterplot A scatterplot can be useful to show the relationship between two values (one on the x-axis and one on the y-axis). The area of the data should be roughly 2/3 of the range of the y-axis. Using points does not require us to begin at a baseline. Using bars, we need to begin at a baseline. That said, there is nothing stopping you from beginning from a baseline if it adds to the message. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Increments on the y-axis should be meaningful. Increments of 3 or 4 are typically bad compared to increments of 2, 5, 10 or 25. If there are many data points at the same spot on the graph, consider jittering them so that the number of points is clearer. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) Finally, if you are plotting multiple categories of data, consider not using a legend but rather labeling the data. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Changing the size of the points can add another layer to the data. Typically, we call these types of graphs bubble plots. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) 5.5 Line Graph A line graph is used to display a trend over time. Unlike bar graphs, a line graph does not need to begin at a baseline. However, beginning the y-axis a few units before the data begins tends to give a nice visual appeal. As always, ensure that your axis increments at the same rate. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) Avoid using lines that are too thick (it hides the detail) or that ar too thin (they are hard to read). As with graphing points, use sensible axis increments and attempt to have your data take roughly 2/3 of the graph range, if possible. The number of lines on a line graph should not exceed four. Avoid the temptation of using dashes or dots to differentiate between the line types. Rather, select colours for each line. If you absolutely need to display more than four categories of data, consider a panel of charts. This avoids the graph looking like spaghetti. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Avoid legends, where possible. If you label the lines directly, the graph becomes clearer and requires less work by the audience to read. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) 5.6 Slopegraph Slopegraphs are very useful in special cases. One case is if we want to see change from one time period to another. A second use is to see change from one category to another especially when the categories have different units. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) If many of the data are overlapping, slopegraphs may not work well. Of course, if we want to draw attention to one or more individual slopes, we can shade them differently than the rest. 5.7 Vertical and Horizontal Bar Graph While many people shy away from bar charts because they are seen as common, in reality they should be used more often because they are so common. Since everyone knows what they are, it takes substantially less effort for people to interpret them leaving them time to hear your message. The term “bar chart” is fairly generic and should be interpreted as bars (horizontal) as well as columns (vertical). Visually, bar charts are easy for our eyes to interpret. We interpret them based on height. However, for this reason, it is important to begin bar charts at a baseline as otherwise we get a false comparison of the height. There is never a reason not to begin at a zero baseline. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) Make sure the bars are not too narrow or too thick. A good rule of thumb is to have the distance between the bars be half of the width of the bars themselves. You should avoid distracting shades and colours for the bars. It is often good practice to put projections in a different shade to emphasize that they are different than the data. Shading and the use of 3D can also interfere with the audience’s ability to determine the height of the bar. If categories on the horizontal axis are long labels, use horizontal bars rather than slanting your text. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Avoid bar colours that alternate between light and dark. Rather, order the colours from lightest to darkest. Never change the order of the bars. If you have a legend, make sure the order of the legend is the same as the order of the bars. When selecting the order of the bars, use an order that makes sense. Ranking is normally a good ordering. In order of time is also a good ordering. Conversely, alphabetical is normally not a good ordering. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) Use direct labeling on your bars to avoid grid lines. However, if you have many bars, a thin line every 4 or 5 bars is acceptable. When graphing negative values, graph them below the x-axis (in the case of vertical bars) or to the left of the vertical axis (in the case of horizontal bars). Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Finally, if you need to compare multiple categories in your visual, avoid putting your charts side-by-side. It is much better to use smaller charts and several of them. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) 5.8 Stacked Bar Graph Stacked bar and column charts are saved for special cases. Most of the time, side-by-side or multiple bar charts would be a better option to a stacked chart. There are two rules for stacked bar charts. First, never use more than 3 categories and second, make sure that the data for the first segment of the bar chart is similar in size. Violating either of these rules makes comparisons after the first level very difficult. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) 5.9 Waterfall Graph A waterfall chart is similar to a bar graph except it pulls pieces of the stack apart to show increases/ decreases incrementally. In the example below, we show how the headcount of a team evolved over the year 2014. We began with an initial headcount, we added in some new hires and we had some employees transfer in. Those are all represented as positive increases to the headcount. We then had some employees transfer out and some employees exit. Those are shown as negative values on the chart. That leaves us with a final headcount at the end of the year. A waterfall chart is a nice way to show changes when the change comes as a result of both positive and negative changes. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) Remember, all of the rules that apply to bar/ column charts also apply here. 5.10 Square Area Graph Most people find deciphering areas very difficult. For that reason, we generally avoid charts that rely on area as the tool of comparison. Pie charts, as you will read below, are among the most difficult to interpret and should be avoided. The one exception to this rule is the square area chart. If you have to visualize numbers with vastly different areas, you might consider square area charts. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) Do not mess too much with the icons. Squares work well (best?) because they are divisible in a sensible way. For example, I know what 25% of a square icon looks like, but I might not know what 25% of a car icon looks like since it is asymmetric. (Also, do not cut icons like people, buildings or airplanes in half - it’s disturbing and might elicit a negative reaction from your audience). Furthermore, if you are going to use icons that are different from squares (perhaps your icon is symmetric like a dot or your data is all in whole numbers), do not change the icon within the graphic. It tends to be more distracting than it is helpful. If your icon is going to represent more than 1 unit, make sure you do not use awkward units like 7 or 13. Use multiples of 2, 5, 10, 25, or 100. If you want to draw a distinction between groups, simply change the shade or colour. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) 5.11 Avoid These When Possible To be fair, the reason we are talking about all of the charts below is that someone thought they were a good idea at some point. However, today they are not used very often. In fact, we hope to give you a number of alternatives when you believe you are forced to use these charts. 5.11.1 Pie Charts Pie charts should only be used in elementary school as a way to teach children how to add fractions. (Moreover, if you ever want to teach my child how to add fractions, stop telling her that she scored 11/10 on her spelling test). As we mentioned earlier, pie charts rely on the audience’s ability to decipher area as a measure. Humans are very bad at doing this. The following example will help illustrate this point (Knaflic (2015)). Ask yourself which supplier has the largest market share in the graph below. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) The consensus answer is supplier B. If you had to guess the share, what would you guess? Most people guess between 35% or 40%. In actuality, the market share is much less. Indeed, it is not even the largest piece of the pie. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) There are a couple of things going on here. First, the graph is tilted and made to look 3D. Because of this, the pieces that are farther away look smaller. However, even when you redraw the graph without the 3D, the challenge of determining the largest piece still remain. When segments are close in size, they cannot easily be interpreted. Why would we simply not use a bar chart? Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) If you must use a pie chart, never put the small segments at 12 o’clock. Put the largest segment at the top (clockwise) with the next largest at the top (counter-clockwise) and filling in from there. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Never use more than five slices. If your data has more than five pieces, graph the first four and then have a category labeled “other” (and place this at the end no matter the size). Avoid distracting colours and special effects like pulling slices out. If you want to highlight a particular slice, shade it a different colour. A bar is almost always better than a pie. This is especially true when you have categorical data that is ranked. If you have data that is categorized as “very poor”, “poor”, “neutral”, “good”, “very good”, then it is more natural to put these on a line with the most negative on the left and the most positive on the right. 5.11.2 Donut Chart Where pie charts ask the reader to evaluate areas, donut charts ask the reader to evaluate arc lengths. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) Again, if you must use a donut chart, remember all of the rules for pie charts. Also, consider including the total for the donut in the centre (it’s empty for a reason after all). Finally, I will encourage you not to use a pie or donut chart but rather a bar chart. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) 5.11.3 3D Charts Don’t use 3D charts. Just don’t. And certainly not for a single dimension (things get weird if you are graphing three dimensions in 3D, but can get done). 3D graphs add unnecessary chart elements that distract from the intended message. For a bar graph, for example, it is difficult to know if your software is actually graphing the front or back of the graph to the height. For example, January and February are both set to the same height. It is not necessarily that obvious by looking at the graph? Would it surprise you to know that each of the bars were set to a whole number height? Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) There are tonnes of issues with 3D - avoid it always. 5.11.4 Secondary Axis A secondary axis can be useful to show a relationship between two items with different scales. However, they should be generally avoided. In the graph below, you can see that there was an increase in the salesforce that coincided with an increase in revenue in Q4. The revenue generated by the company dipped in Q1 and Q2 despite a sustained salesforce through 2014. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) Rather than a secondary axis, here are two alternatives. Both of these give the same information, but avoid the secondary axis. Image Credits - Cole Knaflic (Knaflic (2015)) "],["data-visualization-design.html", "Chapter 6 Data Visualization Design 6.1 Connecting with Visuals 6.2 What is a Good Visualization? 6.3 Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception 6.4 Readability", " Chapter 6 Data Visualization Design 6.1 Connecting with Visuals It is important that we understand how people connect with our visuals if we want to be the most effective in communicating our message. By understanding that, and understanding what is going on inside of their minds, we can use pre-attentive attributes to connect with our audience faster. While it is our eyes that see the visualization, it is our minds that perceive them, and so as someone who creates the visualization, you need to have an idea about how the mind of your audience works. When the prefrontal cortex is engaged, it can be overwhelming to us. So much so that we can miss even the simplest things. As an example, consider “The Door Study” conducted by Daniel Simons and Daniel Levin (Simons and Levin (1998)). In this study, a person (the unknowing participant) is approached in a park by a second person (experimenter A) with a map. Experimenter A asks the participant for directions. As he asks for directions, two men holding a door pass between them and experimenter A is swapped out with a third person (experimenter B). The participant does not realize that experimenter A has been swapped for experimenter B in roughly 50% of the cases since their prefrontal cortex was engaged in using the map. A second example was done by Moran Cerf. In this study, researchers bring you to the lab and play a game in which they show you two cards with two pictures and they say, “Who do you find more attractive? The guy on the left or the guy on the right?” You’ll say perhaps, “The guy on the left is more attractive.” They say, “Fantastic. Here’s the card with this picture of the guy that you just chose. Hold the card in your hand and explain to us in one sentence why you picked this guy.” So you hold it in your hand and you say, “Yeah, I like this guy because he’s smiling.” You keep doing the experiment for about an hour. During the one hour you see dozens of pairs of pictures. Each of them means nothing to you because you don’t know who they are, but each of them is a choice that you make and explain. The interesting part of the experiment is that every now and then, the researcher will hand you the wrong card. What the researchers found were two things: 1. people never noticed that they got the card they didn’t choose. 2. participants held the cards in their hand and then they go on and explain why this is really their choice. Participants make a choice, the researcher changed it and the participant explained it. The moral of these two experiments is that if an audience does not fully understand the story that they are being told, their minds will make up something to fill in the gaps. If our data is too confusing to our audience, in some cases, they will make up a narative to help fill in the gaps. In a perfect world, we would communicate data without involving the prefrontal cortex. We want to hit our audience with a message that strikes the lower brain (the emotional part of their cognative understanding). We are wired to detect differences in shapes, colours, and size. We refer to these as pre-attentive attributes. While it seems easy enough to use these techniques, why do we continue to create bad visuals? It is probably because we do not truly understand the rules. Our objective should always be to keep the prefrontal cortex as still and quiet as possible. We do not really want our audience to think too much. That way, if our message is easy to understand and interpret, we will not divert attention away from our message. 6.2 What is a Good Visualization? Let us begin by defining what one might consider a good visualization. Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) suggests the following three elements are important for a good visualization: Clear meaning, Sophisticated use of contrast, Refined execution. By clear meaning, we mean that the visual communicates the intended insight. Sophisticated use of contrast means that we draw the audience’s attention to the elements that we want them to see and keeps them away from distracting ones. Refined execution puts polish on the visual and helps keep the audience focused on the important parts of the visual. Three preattentive attributes that we are going to discuss are colour, form and spacial position. Image Credits - Lindsay Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) 6.2.1 Colour There are three main attributes of colour: hue, saturation and value (or lightness). Hue refers to different colours (for example, the primary colours). Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Saturation refers to the intensity of the colours. More saturated colours appear darker than colours of the same hue with less saturation. The value of a colour is how light or dark the colour is. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) One thing to remember that items that are similar in colour are perceived as being similar in nature. So, keep in mind colour gradients when selecting your colours. If you have sequential data (like good/ better/ best or population scales), a saturated colour scheme might be best for you. A diverging colour palette (consisting of two distinct colours and a neutral mid-colour) works well when your data has a midpoint. Qualitative colour schemes are used when we have qualitative data that has no association. Do not use too many colours here. Image Credits - Betzendahl (Rowell, Betzendahl, and Brown (2020)) Example: Use colours that make sense for comparassons. Image Credits -Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Example: Graduated shades help focus attention. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Example: Shade scales should be in an appropriate order. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Also, keep in mind that about 10% of the population has some form of colour blindness. Where possible, remove legends and replace them with text on the graph. Converting your graphic (temporarily) to grayscale can help you check if your graphic will be readable to those with vision issues. 6.2.2 Form Form is another pre-attentive attribute that helps us focus our reader’s attention. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Of course, bar graphs take advantage of length, either horizontally or vertically. The audience can tell the difference between a line and a shorter one and they can make judgements about the relitive distance between them (this is the reason why bar graphs must begin at 0). Width is another common attribute of form. Here, we’re talking about the change in length of a bar in the secondary direction. Changing the width of a bar can help draw the audience’s eye to the piece of data on the chart that is the most important. A change of shape is a simple way to distinguish one or two data points from the rest of the group. The same can be said for size. However, be careful that your graph is not using a change in shape or size as an attribute of the data. For example, you should not mark different groups with a different shape on a scatterplot and then use a different shape to try to draw the reader’s attention to a specific data point. Rather, differentiate groups with colour and use a change in shape to point out specific data points. It is important to consider these attributes as not adding additional information to the graph, but rather, they draw the reader’s eye to the correct place. 6.2.3 Spacial Position It is natural to perceive objects that are close together as belonging to a group. Of course, that principle applies directly to tables. Readers can easily scan across and down as these are natural groupings in a table. Additionally, we can help our audience to group by making subtle changes in the arrangement of the data. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) The squares in the diagram above are slightly closer together horizontally which gives us the cue to scan horizontally while the squares on the right are slightly closer vertically which pushes us to scan vertically. Thus, the position of each square relative to each other (or the width in between each square) helps focus our attention in the intended way. Consider these techniques next time you create a table. 6.3 Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception In 1912, psychologists began studying what is know known as Gestalt psychology. Gestalt is a German term meaning shape, form or pattern. This branch of psychology emphasizes the importance of perception and the organization of sensory information in to meaningful wholes or groups. Gestalt principles and pre-attentive attributes work together in the process of visual perception. Pre-attentive attributes are basic visual features that the human brain processes automatically and unconsciously. Gestalt principles, describe how these pre-attentive attributes are organized into meaningful patterns and structures. The Gestalt principles provide a framework for how pre-attentive attributes are organized and perceived as meaningful patterns. By grouping similar elements together, organizing them based on proximity or closure, and filling in missing information to complete patterns, the Gestalt principles help the brain to make sense of complex visual information. 6.3.1 Gestalt principles The Principle of Proximity The Principle of Proximity suggests that visual elements that are close to each other tend to be perceived as related and belonging together. When visual elements are close together, the brain perceives them as being related, even if there are no other visual cues to suggest this. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Principle of Similarity The Principle of Similarity is a perceptual organization principle that suggests that objects that share similar visual characteristics tend to be perceived as a group or pattern. In other words, elements that look alike are grouped together in the mind of the viewer. This principle operates on the idea that the human brain tends to organize sensory input into distinct groups, with elements that share common characteristics being grouped together. These characteristics can include similar shape, size, color, texture, or orientation. Here, we have shaded columns differently drawing the reader’s attention down each column. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Principle of Enclosure The Principle of Enclosure is a visual design principle that refers to the use of boundaries or shapes to enclose or group related elements together. It suggests that elements that are visually enclosed within a boundary or shape tend to be perceived as a single unit or group. This principle works on the idea that the human brain is wired to perceive objects that are contained within a boundary as a single entity. By using boundaries or shapes to enclose related elements, designers can create a visual hierarchy and make it easier for viewers to understand the relationships between different elements. In the image below, both sets of circles are identical. The grouping makes them seem different. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Principle of Closure The Principle of Closure is a perceptual organization principle that suggests that the human brain tends to perceive incomplete or fragmented information as complete and whole. This means that the brain will fill in the missing gaps and perceive a complete image, even if some parts of it are missing or not visible. The principle of closure works on the idea that the human brain seeks to make sense of the world around us by grouping visual elements together and creating a cohesive picture. When there are gaps or missing information in a visual image, the brain automatically fills in these gaps to create a complete image. It is natural to look at these figures and see a rectangle and an oval even though they are neither shape. Use this principle in your graphics to reduce your non-data ink. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Principle of Continuity The Principle of Continuity is a perceptual organization principle that suggests that the human brain tends to perceive visual elements that are arranged in a continuous or flowing manner as related and belonging together. This principle suggests that the eye will naturally follow a smooth and continuous path, even if the elements change or vary along that path. This principle relies on the idea that the human brain seeks to organize sensory information into coherent and meaningful patterns. When visual elements are arranged in a continuous and flowing manner, the brain perceives them as a unified whole, even if there are breaks or variations in the elements. The image on the left is a rectangle and wavy line. Our brain naturally assumes that if we decouple the two images, we would end up with the middle image even though the image on the right is just as likely. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Principle of Connection The Principle of Connection is a visual design principle that suggests that visual elements that are visually connected or linked together tend to be perceived as related and belonging together. This principle operates on the idea that the human brain organizes visual information into patterns and relationships based on visual connections between elements. Visual connections can take many forms, such as lines, arrows, or other visual cues that suggest a relationship or connection between elements. By creating visual connections between elements, designers can guide the viewer’s eye through a design and emphasize important relationships between different elements. Most people connect the dots vertically due to the lines that join them even though the 4 dots are equally spaced horizontally and vertically. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) Additionally, the graphs below have the same arrangement of dots. However, the one on the right seems to tell a much different story than the one on the left because of it is connected. Looking at the two graphs, the audience gets the impression that points on the right graph should be grouped together or that the “next point” comes from the “previous point” while there is no such similar sense from the left graph. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) The Gestalt principles of visual perception can help you refine your visualizations (tables and graphs). Remember them, the story you want to tell, and the place you want to focus the audience attention, when you are constructing your visualizations. Image Credits - Stephen Few (Few (2012)) 6.4 Readability There are some basic rules that will help improve the legibility of our visuals. As always, we want to make it as simple as possible for our audience to understand the message. Time taken to try to understand the visual takes away from our time to deliver the message. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Some of these are basic, but are worth remembering: Make sure the typeface is not too small or squished. Typeface should be simple with either bold or italics used to emphasize. Do not use both. Also avoid stylized typefaces. Writing in all caps is difficult to read. Use proper uppercase and lowercase letters. Do not print white typeface over a black background. Where it makes sense, do not rotate the typeface. Label the graph directly where applicable. Example: Remember to check your typography. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Example: Remember to check your font. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Example: Do not write in white over black. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Example: Bold text should be used sparingly. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Example: Legends and labels that appear at a distance can be difficult to quickly read. Image Credits - Donna Wong (Wong (2010)) Where possible, remove legends and use labels directly on the graphic. They are both easier to read and also tend to give you back room on your graphic.

With your audience in mind, consider what you are trying to tell them. Is the presentation simply an informative presentation? Are you trying to persuade someone? Perhaps you have to impress someone with your visualization. The point is that both the audience and purpose matters. Consider a non-profit group trying to fight suburban poverty. One of the things the group is going to need to discuss is the increase in people in poverty living in the suburbs versus living in the city. Below is a chart that shows how people in poverty have moved outside of the city into the suburbs. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) What does this graphic say? Somewhere between 2000 and 2010, the population shifted from being primarily in cities to primarily in the suburbs. There is nothing wrong with it. A better version is included below. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) The new version shows immediately the surge in poor people living in the suburbs since 2000. The fact that we use the word “surge” to describe the second graph rather than the adjective “shift” or “increase”, speaks to the increased power of persuasiveness in the second visualization. The goal, when you are creating a graphic for persuasive purposes, is to create a graphic that leads to action. It isn’t simply enough that the chart is “true”; it needs to suggest a way forward. The science of influence is a branch of psychology that plays a significant role in success. Three strategies that we use to influence behaviour or thinking: economic, social and environmental. Economic strategies are carrot and stick types of strategies. There are benefits to doing one thing and negative consequences to doing another. Social strategies are often driven by outside influences. we should be doing things one way because everyone else is doing it this way. Environmental strategies include environmental factors like having relaxing music in hospitals and doctor’s offices. There are many examples of these types of strategies. Changing the physical environment even slightly can have a huge impact on persuasion. Persuasion in visualization works in a similar way. Steve J. Martin writes: “Whilst we’d like to think that our decisions are the result of effortful cognition, the reality is somewhat different. Much of our behaviour is driven by unconscious cues present in our environment.” (Berinato (2016)). Even descriptions can be jazzed up in order to persuade your audience. My house is 5 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms and nearly 4000 square feet with a small yard. Conversely, my house can be described as a very large open-concept three story home, suitable for a large family, situated on a low-maintenance lot with golf course views out the back porch. The point here is that one of these is descriptive while the other is persuasive. If you have a visualization and you have an opinion on how it should be interpreted, jazz it up so that it is interpreted the way you intended. Use unconscious cues (Gestalt principles) like colour, contrast, space, words, what you show and what you leave out, to heighten the effect. Here’s another example. The graph below is fine (though, it should probably be horizontal rather than vertical). But, if you want to persuade people that beer is expensive at baseball games, this likely won’t do it without a significant explaination from you. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) The image below is far more persuasive. It very quickly demonstrates how expensive beer is at baseball games. Admittidely, it is slightly over the top, but it does drive the point home. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) 7.2 Three Tips Example: Which graph convinces you that there is an issue with the west coast sales team? Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) While the graph on the left is more detailed, the main message is lost in the sea of details. The graph on the right shows a much clearer story of the west coast sales team having problems. Remember, details are not the key to getting your message across. Making your message impossibly obvious is the key. Scott Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) lays out three tips to persuade your audience. Hone the main idea, Make it stand out, Adjust what’s around it. 7.2.1 Hone the Main Idea Rather than approaching your data by asking “what am I trying to show”, it is often times better to say “I need to convince them that…”. Consider the urban poverty example. Rather than saying “I want to compare suburban and urban poverty”, you would be better served by saying “I need to convince people that suburban poverty is a rapidly growing problem. Example: Rather than approaching your visualization with the statement: “I am trying to show how increasing hours spent on work isn’t increasing productivity”. You may be better served approaching your visualization with the idea: “I need to convince them that all this extra work we do is backfiring. It’s hurting the company’s productivity rather than helping”. One thing to notice when you approach your visualization by trying to convince your audience is that the language changes and often is more emotional. Your focus has changed from visualizing an idea to persuading someone that the idea is good. You have gone from “I want you to know something” to “I need you to believe something”. From here, there is an automatic link between statistical terminology (increasing, declining, under-served, etc.) and words that elicit feelings (hurting, helping, hungry for). 7.2.2 Make it Stand Out Here is where all the preattentive attributes and Gestalt principles come into play. Example: Look at how we change our poverty graph to come up with a final persuasive visual. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Why do we not like the first 5 iterations? 1. The overlay of semitransparent colors creates a third color that dominates the chart and draws attention to the filled area, not the lines. This clearly highlights suburban poverty more, but why is one shaded and one not? The shaded area is still distracting. Darker and lighter hues of the same color suggest two variables in a group, not a comparison. The idea is to contrast, not complement. Black on white provides the most contrast, but black and blue don’t contrast so much that the black line pops. Better! But the blue is still fighting for attention. The goal is to draw attention to the orange line. Final color choice. Other things to consider are the inclusion of demarcations, pointers and labels. Here’s an example where demarcations help editorialize the story. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Example: The following chart is meant to emphasize the growing issue with student loans. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) While it is factually correct and uses many correct visualization techniques, it suffers from the issue that the green line is the first thing we tend to see. So, the solution is to emphasize the point of the graph. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Data visualization software does an exceptionally poor job at anticipating what visual cues we might want to inject into the visualization. That should be expected, though. Software renders data; but, good visualizations are all about presenting ideas. So when you make a graph, take a few minutes and try to intervene and make use of techniques that bring your ideas to the forefront. 7.2.3 Adjust What is Around It Remember, the point of the visualization is to highlight your message. So, changing what is around the data is a great way to help craft your message. Here are some hints: Remove reference points, Add reference points, Shift reference points. Example: This chart is meant to persuade us that there is an age divide in what people want from products. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) If this graph does persuade you that there is an age divide, and I’m not 100% sure it does, did you come to that conclusion quickly? By removing the reference points (yellow and green bars), the story is much clearer. A new title also drives home the point we are trying to make. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) This is a situation in which removing the unnecessary data helps bring the message into focus. Intuitively, it might seem logical that removing data will always bring your story into focus. After all, it removes visual distractions so your reader can focus only on the important data. However, sometimes adding data can serve to add context. The graph below would seem to indicate that vinyl records are making a comeback. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) The reality is that what appears to be a trend, is only a blip. The addition of the reference point shows how small this increase really is. It adds perspective to the story. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Another way to think about this story is to shift the reference entirely. While a resurgence might be taking place, it is minimal compared to music sales overall. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Another example of changing the reference is the beer at ballgames example. A small beer is a different size depending on which ballpark you go to. So, we’re really looking at a cost per ounce. People do not talk about the cost of an ounce of beer - but they do talk about the cost of a case of beer. So, comparing it to that reference adds context to the story and allows us to compare to something that is well known. Remember, while you do not want to distort the data, persuasion is fine. There is no such thing as a 100% objective graph because our brains are not 100% objective. Image Credits - Scott Berinato (Berinato (2016)) Consider what is happening in the graph on the left. There is an increase rising to a plateau, followed by an interval of decrease of roughly the same amount of time. In the graph on the right, there is a sharp increase and the decrease is substantially more bumpy. The stories are very different. Except that they aren’t. They are the same graph with one adjusted for the computer (the left) and the other adjusted for a smartphone (right). So, is one more objective than the other? No, the size rescaled (correctly) to adjust for the medium. Here we have the same data with a very different experience for the audience.

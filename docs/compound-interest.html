<li>A payment stream consists of $1950 due today and $3500 due in 18 months.

<li>Payments of $1850 due two years ago and $1550 due six months ago have not been made. The proposed alternative is two equal payments, three months and nine months from now, that will put the payee in an equivalent economic position allowing that money can earn 4.3% compounded quarterly. What is the amount of each of these payments?
<ul>
<li>$1838.15

It is proposed to replace this stream by an economically equivalent stream comprised of three equal payments due one, three, and five years from now. Determine the size of each payment if money is worth 4% compounded annually.

<li>$8572.18

<li>Payments of $10,000 due 15 months ago and $7000 due in six months are to be replaced by a
payment of $4000 today, a second payment in nine months, and a third payment, three times
as large as the second, in 1.5 years. What should the last two payments be if money is worth
6.4% compounded quarterly?

<li>Three years ago, Ayia loaned $2500 to John. The principal with interest at 8% compounded semiannually is to be repaid four years from the date of the loan. Eighteen months ago, John borrowed another $1500 for 2.5 years at 7% compounded semiannually. John is now proposing to settle both debts with two equal payments to be made one and three years from now. What should the payments be if money now earns 6% compounded quarterly?

##  3.1  Introduction to Calculus {-}

Find the derivative of each of the following functions.  

*  $y = x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$  
    *  $y^{\prime} = = 5x^4 + 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$
<p>&nbsp;</p>


*  $y = 3x^2 + 10x - 5$
    *  $y^{\prime} = 6x + 10$
<p>&nbsp;</p>


*  $y = 20x^5 - 10 x^3 + 6x - 15$
    *  $y^{\prime} = 100x^4 - 30x^2 + 6$
<p>&nbsp;</p>


*  
    *
<p>&nbsp;</p>


*  $y = 15x - 25x^2 + 1000$
    *  $y^{\prime} = 15  - 50x$
<p>&nbsp;</p>


*  $y = 75x - 20x^2 + 10000$
    *  $y^{\prime} = 75 - 40x$
